    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 17, 2026</p>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Prompt Store</strong>, an application owned and operated by <strong>ALL TIPS NOW</strong>. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collected for Gemini API & Image Processing</h2>
    <p>Our app provides AI-powered prompt generation by utilizing the <strong>Google Gemini API</strong>. To provide this service, the following data is processed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Image Uploads:</strong> When you select an image to generate a prompt, the image is securely uploaded to our server and sent to Gemini API for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Analysis:</strong> The AI analyzes the visual content to generate descriptive text. We do not use your private images for training AI models.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend Storage:</strong> Uploaded images are stored on our secure servers to allow you to retrieve your generated prompts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Sharing Your Information with Third Parties (APIs)</h2>
    <p>We share necessary information with the following service providers to ensure app functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> Receives image data to generate AI prompts.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Receives Advertising IDs to serve relevant advertisements.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase (FCM):</strong> Used to deliver push notifications and app updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>Our app and related services use "Cookies" and similar tracking technologies (like Advertising IDs) to remember your preferences and show personalized ads through AdMob. You can reset your Advertising ID via your Android device settings.</p>

    <h2>4. GDPR and Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), we use the <strong>Google User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to collect your explicit consent before showing personalized ads. You have the right to access or delete the data we hold about you.</p>

    <h2>5. Storage & Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires <strong>READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong> to pick images from your gallery and save AI results. These are only accessed when you perform an action within the app.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures (SSL/HTTPS) to protect your data during transmission between the app and our Laravel-based backend.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Deletion Request (Non-Account Users)</h2>
    <p>Since <strong>Prompt Store</strong> does not require a user account (login), we identify your data based on your unique <strong>Device ID</strong>. If you wish to delete your uploaded images and generated prompts from our server, please follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email us at <span class="highlight">support@alltipsnow.com</span> with the subject "Data Deletion Request".</li>
        <li>Provide your <strong>Device ID</strong> (found in the app's About/Settings section) so we can identify your data.</li>
        <li>Once verified, all images and records associated with that ID will be permanently deleted from our database within 7-10 business days.</li>
    </ul>
